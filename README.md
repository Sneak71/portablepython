# Portable Python - No Installation Required!

Have you ever had any problems installing multiple versions of Python on your machine?

Did you need multiple Python patch releases on your machine for some reason at the same time?

You uninstalled Python but it still showed up in installed apps?

If you answered yes at least once, then this project will have you covered!

This project contains a bunch of Python releases packaged in zip archives. The archives are created from files installed by the official Python installer, nothing else. Each version will have a 32-bit and 64-bit version available.

Check out [releases](https://github.com/oswjk/portablepython/releases) for downloads!
